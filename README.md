# DeepLearning_Keras

I wanted to learn more about using TensorFlow's Keras (versus PyTorch) and deep learning/neural networks. The files in this repository were created after viewing a bootcamp class created by Deep Lizard.

The instructor is young and well spoken.  Deep Lizard has a course called "Keras with TensorFlow" that was uploaded to Youtube in June 2020. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFJeN9V1ZsI&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org 

Side note: when looking at tech content, I think it's important to see how "old" the content is. I was an academic and am really aware that folks in ivory towers who do not really use the technology in a practical way may not understand the changes/latest and greatest of the tech they teach.

I apply this side-eye view to a lot of courses on Coursera or Udemy. Look at when they were created. In the tech world, years old is ancient.

So I frequently try to find newer produced content online. A lot of it is junky or not presented well. And, of course, there's a way to get you to buy something. In this Deep Lizard course, they won't release the code/Jupyter Notebook/Python files unless you shell out some money. We'll see if it's worth it, imho.
